**Python path info**

if your python is installed to a different place than on the script make sure to change that too. But most of the time it should be in the same place as mine.

**Installing pip modules**

To install the python modules just simply run the 'setup' file

**IMPORTANT**

When you have downloaded the tool make sure to rename the file to 'InfoTaker' as it wont be able to detect the path otherwise.
